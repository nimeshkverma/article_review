SELF INTROSPECTION
Posted on 10 Days Ago by Serendipity of Life

Introspection

In Our day to day life we come across many people for whom we think, about their thinking, about their life about their work and at last end up saying “In these so and so time span I am not able to understand the person in “real”(it doesn’t matter whether we know them or not).

But instead of thinking about our own life, our own self for that we are too busy and engaged in thinking about them.
We never have time, we are never free for it and the 90% the people never thought of it, never thought of self-introspection, never thought of thinking about their own self, inspecting ourself.
Many times some questions arises in everyone’s mind

“WHO I AM”

“WHAT’S THE PURPOSE OF MY LIFE”

“WHAT I GAINED FROM MY LIFE”

“IS I AM HAPPY OR HAVE PEACEFUL LIFE IF NOT THEN WHAT SHOULD I DO INORDER TO ATTAIN IT”

31-the-meaning-of-life

Many such more questions arises when we are all alone far away from the feel and sense of hectic life away from all the people.

Whom we care or not it’s the time when we unknowingly think about our self and then these questions arises but instead of thinking and analyzing about it we suppress those thought ,those questions because they make you think about yourself about your life about your success and failure, about you happy and painful moments but the memories of failure starts outweighing those of the successful and so does the painful memories and then these memories starts unbalancing your mood, starts burning your calories or even ending up with diseases.

Actually we think in the wrong directions the end moments of those memories instead of thinking the reason behind those memories what had happen that made you ending up at that point or what were your mistakes but at last we think we are messing up and then we return to those crowded places where people bark about their life time experience, return to the hectic schedule.

We run away from those memory, we behave like the Ostrich burying head in the sand and feeling he escaped from the situation but you can never escape from it..

head-in-sand

We always blame the scarcity of time for the self-introspection, for deep thinking but we have enough of time for social networking, chatting with random people, for foolish devices ,for the idiot box ,for those people whom you hate / dislike but not for yourself.

We often read autobiographies, self-improvements book in search of gaining MANTRA of life to make it easier by reading others experience but never have enough of sense to look into our self’s experiences and gaining out of it either it’s a good or bad ,success or failure..

But the Mantra resides our self the only trouble with all of us that we are unable to see it we do not take enough of the trouble to find it instead we start believing and trusting on others life experiences thinking that it might work for our life’s also but this is our mistake….

We are too busy in thinking about others life whether it’s our relative, our beloved or even the strange person…

How others see us should fall pale in comparison to how we see ourselves. Introspection, in longer run, outweighs perception……

So At a point we should stop in the race of life not thinking that it will delay our success but instead giving thoughts to those

Question which comes to our mind, thinking about our self, our purpose of coming to this world….

So that you can have a smooth race thereafter and who knows you can be the WINNER…

And when you start thinking about yourself, self-introspecting then we will realize that all answers to our question lies inside us….
